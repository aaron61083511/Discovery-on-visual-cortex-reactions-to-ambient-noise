Requirements are listed in requirements.txt, and can be installed via pip install -r requirements.txt.

The notebook was run on a Python 3.6 kernel.

The only plot that takes a long time to run is the spectrogram of the full audio file - we recommend either getting a very powerful computer, or running the sample computation on the first 60 seconds, which is just below that plot in the notebook.

Other relevant code such as preprocessing and data splitting are also supplied.

The filepaths are given as relative paths, and should be placed in a directory ./data relative
to the Jupyter notebook.
